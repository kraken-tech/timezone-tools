## Unreleased

### Fixed

- This project has always been released under the BSD 3-clause license,
  but the project metadata incorrectly listed the `MIT` SPDX license expression.
  That has been corrected to `BSD-3-Clause`.

## [0.1.0.post1] - 2025-05-02

This release updates the package metadata to reflect:

- the new repository location in the `kraken-tech` GitHub org;
- compatibility with Python 3.13;
- the license as specified by a SPDX license classifier.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-07-11

The first release of this package.
